List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases that guide the development of software from conception to deployment and maintenance. Here are the key phases:

1. Planning:
   - Define the project scope, objectives, and resources. Identify the feasibility and potential risks.

2. Requirements Analysis:
   - Gather and analyze the user and business requirements to ensure the software meets the necessary needs.

3. Design:
   - Create detailed software architecture and design specifications, including system components, data structures, and interfaces.

4. Implementation (Coding):
   - Write the actual code based on the design documents, translating the design into a working software product.

5. Testing:
   - Validate and verify the software by identifying and fixing bugs to ensure it meets the specified requirements.

6. Deployment:
   - Release the software to the end-users or production environment, making it available for use.

7. Maintenance:
   - Perform ongoing updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to ensure the software remains functional and relevant.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

 Waterfall Methodology
- Linear and Sequential: Follows a fixed sequence of phases (e.g., Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance).
- Documentation-Driven: Emphasizes detailed documentation at each stage before moving to the next.
- Limited Flexibility: Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
- Example Scenario: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change, such as government contracts or infrastructure projects.

 Agile Methodology
- Iterative and Incremental: Divides the project into small, manageable iterations (sprints), allowing continuous improvement and adaptation.
- Collaboration-Focused: Encourages frequent communication and collaboration between cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
- Highly Flexible: Easily accommodates changes in requirements, even late in the development process.
- Example Scenario: Ideal for projects with evolving requirements, such as software startups, mobile app development, or web applications.

 Comparison
- Process: Waterfall is rigid and linear, while Agile is flexible and iterative.
- Change Management: Waterfall resists changes after planning, whereas Agile embraces them.
- Documentation: Waterfall requires comprehensive documentation, while Agile focuses more on working software and stakeholder collaboration.
- Timeline: Waterfall projects typically have a longer timeline, with all phases completed before moving to the next, while Agile delivers working software incrementally in shorter cycles.

When to Use
- Waterfall: Best for projects with stable, unchanging requirements, clear deadlines, and where thorough documentation is necessary.
- Agile: Best for projects where requirements may change, there’s a need for frequent reassessment, or rapid delivery is crucial.
